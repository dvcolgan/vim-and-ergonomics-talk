Hi my name is David Colgan
I run a little Django and sometimes Nodejs web dev consultancy called Less Boring.
I use Vim every day in my work and have done so for at least 10 years now I think it is.

I'd like to share some thoughts with you about Vim and Ergonomics.

I've put a fair amount of time into optimizing my computer ergonomics, and I'm a big fan of things like standing desks and the Roost stand, anything that removes the folded in half syndrome of coding on a laptop.

Another aspect of ergonomics is taking care of your wrists while typing, and that's what I'd like to focus on here.

Now, I would say that Vim is already the most ergonomic text editor even without any customization. Thanks to the way it reduces the need for modifier keys and it's modal nature, you can reduce unnecessary movements to the arrow keys and mouse.

But today I'd like to offer you 3 ways that you can take your Vimming ergonomics to the next level.

1. Make Escape Easier to hit
Show 4 pictures:
normal typing 1
normal typing 2
switch between them
anticipation
super reach to the escape key with pinky

I would argue that escape is the most important key in effictive Vimming.  Very early on I was given the excellent advice to stay out of insert mode as much as possible.  If you stay in insert mode and use the arrow keys, Vim is in many ways worse of a text editor than Notepad.  The real power is in normal mode.

But some smart person decided that the rest of the world didn't need escape very much and stuck it way up here, requiring us Vimmers to do some form of this weird spasm every time you leave insert mode!

When I'm doing fine text surgery on my code, I can be hitting escape every few seconds.  This is not fun.

Answer: move escape closer.

Put it on Caps Lock
Use Ctrl+c
Use Ctrl+[
Use an insert mode combo like jj or jk
inoremap jk <esc>

2. Reclaim the Alt key

But now I hear what you must surely be saying, "David, we switched to Vim so that we WOULDNT have to use Emacs.  What's this about ctrl keys?"

And you would be right, because the ctrl key, while one of the most important keys on the keyboard, is the hardest key to type.

You have to either use this

very innacurate pinky extend and hope you hit the key
show normal
or you can use the pinky knucle
show normal
or you can use this ungodly whole wrist curling motion

The pinky get's a bad deal
It is by far the weakest finger, but it has by far the most keys it has to hit!

Keys hit most commonly should be hit by the strongest finger.  Can we somehow move control key duty to the thumb?



The most difficult key to hit on a keyboard is also one of the most important in general: Ctrl
Show pictures
normal typing 1
normal typing 2
painful ctrl key pressing

There are a couple of ways of doing this
Windows SharkKeys and AutoHotKey
Linux - Ubuntu has it built in or Xmodmap
Mac OSX


3. Reclaim the Spacebar

Okay so moving keys around might be a little too much for you to handle, and I definitely understand that.  But this final idea can be done by every one of you because I guarantee you don't already use this key for ANYTHING.

Let's go back to our big strong friends our two thumbs.  The spacebar is one of the most commonly hit keys on the keyboard in insert mode, but have you ever used it in command mode?  You may be pleasantly surprised to find that this amazing key is mapped to nothing other than move right.  The same as the right arrow key or L.  Since we already have at least two ways of doing this exact movement, we can use space for all of our most common custom shortcuts!

The spacebar is the easiest key to hit.  You can use either of your thumbs, and they even rest normally above it.  So why  are we not using this key way more often?

Map your leader to <space>

Use it for anything!

I like to

    no <space><space> :wa<cr>
    no <space>h :nohlsearch<cr>
